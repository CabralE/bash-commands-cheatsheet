# Bash Commands Cheatsheet

Here's a cheatsheet I'm using to remember some of the most common `bash` commands:

### Navigating the file system

#####  Terminal commands:


- `cd` : current directory
-  `cd.` : 
-  `cd..` : parent directory
- `cd ~` : revert back to the previous directory
- `cd /` : looks this folder 
- `ls -a` : look search - all - this command lists hidden and non-hidden content.
- `ls -l` : look search - long - this command lists all files with full information ( created/ who can change, etc)
- `ls -la`: look search -long all - this command lists hidden and non-hidden content and all of the information.
- `pwd`: print working directory - lists the contents of the directory the terminal is in.
- `mkdir` : creates a new folder in current directory
- `touch`: creates new files
- `rm` : removes files
- `rm -r` : removes directories
- `mv ~` : moves folders and files (ex:~/parent folder/child folder/directory ~/)
- `mv` : changes the file name (mv warm.pjs summer pjs)
- `mv` * . : this moves folders and files as well.
- `cp *` : copies files and directories
- `cp -R` :
- `man cp` : prints manual
- `cmd + c` : to stop whatever your terminal is doing.
